# 2D Block Decomposition Method implementation in Python
#  2018 
#
# Based on the paper "A Decomposition Method for Global Evaluation of Shannon
# Entropy and Local Estimations of Algorithmic Complexity", by Zenil et al. in
# Entropy 2018, 20(8), 605; https://doi.org/10.3390/e20080605
# and in previous code by Hector Zenil and Fernando Soler-Toscano
#
# No boundary conditions are implemented (the leftovers after block
# decomposition are ignored in the BDM calculation).
#
# Usage:
#     python BDM.py [input-file] [lookup-file]
#
# If no argument is provided, the script shows an example run.
# If one argument is provided, it is used as input file.
# If two arguments are provided, the first one is the input file while the
# second one is a custom lookup table that replaces the default one (base
# submatrices of size 4 x 4).

    """
    Implementation of the 2-dimensional Block Decomposition Method (BDM) for
    the approximation of algorithmic information (also known as algorithmic
    information content or Kolmogorov complexity) of binary matrices.

    The matrix is subdivided into d x d base submatrices, each of wich will be
    assigned an algorithmic information content through a lookup table (the table
    itself will have been constructed through the Coding Theorem Method (CTM)).
    The output value for matrix M is

    BDM(M) = sum_i (CTM(m_i) + log_2(n_i))

    where i indexes the unique base submatrices m_i that appear in the
    decomposition, and n_i is the number of times each of these submatrices is used.

    After all possible d x d submatrices are fitted inside the original matrix,
    some leftover rows and columns might remain. This issue can be addressed through
    different boundary condition strategies but here the leftovers are simply ignored.

    Input
    --------
    string : string
        binary matrix in string format, where rows are separated by minus signs
    lookup : dict
        key is base matrix, value is its CTM value. Base matrices must be of
        size d x d.
    d : integer
        size of base matrices.
    verbose : bool
        If True, prints input matrix, the submatrices into which it is decomposed, and
        the number of times each of these submatrices appear in the original matrix.

    Output
    ------
    bdm : float
        BDM value for the matrix.
