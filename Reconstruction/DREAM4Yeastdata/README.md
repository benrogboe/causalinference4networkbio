Verified interaction network data from DREAM4 challenge.
Networks are subnetworks from transcriptional regulatory networks of E. coli and S. cerevisiae. Auto-regulatory interactions were removed.
The dynamics of the networks were simulated using a detailed kinetic model of gene regulation. Both independent and synergistic gene regulation occur in the networks. Both transcription and translation are modeled. The datasets correspond to the mRNA concentration levels.
The simulations are based on stochastic differential equations (Langevin equations) to model internal noise in the dynamics of the networks.
