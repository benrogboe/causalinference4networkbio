@INCOLLECTION{Mao_undated-xi,
  title     = "{SimplePPT}: A Simple Principal Tree Algorithm",
  booktitle = "Proceedings of the 2015 {SIAM} International Conference on Data
               Mining",
  author    = "Mao, Qi and Yang, Le and Wang, Li and Goodison, Steve and Sun,
               Yijun",
  abstract  = "Abstract Many scientific datasets are of high dimension, and the
               analysis usually requires visual manipulation by retaining the
               most important structures of data. Principal curve is a widely
               used approach for this purpose. However, many existing methods
               work only for data with structures that are not
               self-intersected, which is quite restrictive for real
               applications. To address this issue, we develop a new model,
               which captures the local information of the underlying graph
               structure based on reversed graph embedding. A generalization
               bound is derived that show that the model is consistent if the
               number of data points is sufficiently large. As a special case,
               a principal tree model is proposed and a new algorithm is
               developed that learns a tree structure automatically from data.
               The new algorithm is simple and parameter-free with guaranteed
               convergence. Experimental results on synthetic and breast cancer
               datasets show that the proposed method compares favorably with
               baselines and can discover a breast cancer progression path with
               multiple branches.",

@ARTICLE{Anders2010-oc,
  title    = "Differential expression analysis for sequence count data",
  author   = "Anders, Simon and Huber, Wolfgang",
  abstract = "High-throughput sequencing assays such as RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq or
              barcode counting provide quantitative readouts in the form of
              count data. To infer differential signal in such data correctly
              and with good statistical power, estimation of data variability
              throughout the dynamic range and a suitable error model are
              required. We propose a method based on the negative binomial
              distribution, with variance and mean linked by local regression
              and present an implementation, DESeq, as an R/Bioconductor
              package.",

@ARTICLE{Treutlein2014-ee,
  title     = "Reconstructing lineage hierarchies of the distal lung epithelium
               using single-cell {RNA-seq}",
  author    = "Treutlein, Barbara and Brownfield, Doug G and Wu, Angela R and
               Neff, Norma F and Mantalas, Gary L and Hernan Espinoza, F and
               Desai, Tushar J and Krasnow, Mark A and Quake, Stephen R",
  abstract  = "The mammalian lung is a highly branched network in which the
               distal regions of the bronchial tree transform during
               development into a densely packed honeycomb of alveolar air sacs
               that mediate gas exchange. Although this transformation has been
               studied by marker expression analysis and fate-mapping, the
               mechanisms that control the progression of lung progenitors
               along distinct lineages into mature alveolar cell types are
               still incompletely known, in part because of the limited number
               of lineage markers and the effects of ensemble averaging in
               conventional transcriptome analysis experiments on cell
               populations. Here we show that single-cell transcriptome
               analysis circumvents these problems and enables direct
               measurement of the various cell types and hierarchies in the
               developing lung. We used microfluidic single-cell RNA sequencing
               (RNA-seq) on 198 individual cells at four different stages
               encompassing alveolar differentiation to measure the
               transcriptional states which define the developmental and
               cellular hierarchy of the distal mouse lung epithelium. We
               empirically classified cells into distinct groups by using an
               unbiased genome-wide approach that did not require a priori
               knowledge of the underlying cell types or the previous
               purification of cell populations. The results confirmed the
               basic outlines of the classical model of epithelial cell-type
               diversity in the distal lung and led to the discovery of many
               previously unknown cell-type markers, including transcriptional
               regulators that discriminate between the different populations.
               We reconstructed the molecular steps during maturation of
               bipotential progenitors along both alveolar lineages and
               elucidated the full life cycle of the alveolar type[thinsp]2
               cell lineage. This single-cell genomics approach is applicable
               to any developing or mature tissue to robustly delineate
               molecularly distinct cell types, define progenitors and lineage
               hierarchies, and identify lineage-specific regulatory factors.",
